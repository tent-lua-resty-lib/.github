<img src=../assets/tent-lua-resty-lib.png width=200 height=200 />

## Description

This is a sanctuary for lua-resty libs.

## Why

Some lua-resty libs have lost their maintainers or archived, but they are still used by some projects or required by someone, we still see people submitting issues or PRs to these libs, but the maintainers are not responding.

So we want to make a sanctuary for these libs, and keep them adapted to the latest OpenResty.

## What We Do

## Minimum maintenance

We will only do the minimum maintenance for these libs, including:

- bugfix
- update dependencies
- make tests pass
- update CI/CD
- regular release

### No New Features or Enhancements

We will not add any new features or enhancements to these libs, if you want to add new features or enhancements, please fork it and maintain it yourself.

### No Breaking Changes

We will not make any breaking changes to these libs, if you want to make breaking changes, please fork it and maintain it yourself.

### Temporary Shelter

If the original maintainer is returned, we will gladly hand back the reins, and cooperate with the original maintainer to feedback the changes to the original repo.

### Maintenance cycle

We don's promise any maintenance cycle, but we will try our best to maintain these libs.

### Disclaimer

This project is driven by community, and we are not responsible for any problems caused by the use of these libs, please use them at your own risk.

Also, this project is not affiliated with the official OpenResty organization.

## Licenses

All the libs in this project are fork from the original repo, and licensed under the same license as the original repo.
